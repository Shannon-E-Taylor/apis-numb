scripts to get SCRMshaw working on the honeybee genome. 

we used the Amel_4.5 and Amel_2.0 assemblies from Beebase. The .gff files differ in their assignment of genes and exons- Amel_4.5 calls them 'genes' and 'exons' while Amel_2.0 has "mRNA" and "CDS". The R script extract_genes_and_exons.R may need to be modified accordingly
